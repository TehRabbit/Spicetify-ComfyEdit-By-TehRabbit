The theme part is now updating itself for users using the version of Spicetify equals or greater than `2.8.2`, however, for the extesnion part if you have issues with it :

2. Copy the whole code (sorry for the flashbang)
3. Go into the Spicetify extension folder
4. Open the `Comfy.js` file, paste the code and **save it**
4. Afterwards, in a terminal, run `spicetify apply`
5. Enjoy !

For the users that don't want to update Spicetify to the newest version, do the same with [this](https://nyri4.github.io/Comfy-spicetify/Comfy.js) and paste it in the `user.css` replacing the `@import`.
